# Creating Custom Themes (instructions for end users)

The easiest way of customizing a theme is by editing the BMP textures in a theme's *ui*, *battery*, or *volume* folder. These BMP textures must be in RGB565 format, and use `#FF00FF` as a transparent key color. BMP textures are allowed to vary in size, but may require tweaking of the theme configuration to render correctly (see below).

Changes to paletted textures are more involved. Within the *grit* folder of a theme, the various image files may be edited. You will also require [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) with GRIT installed. Once you have finished editing your files, you must run

```bash
$ make
```

In order to compile your themes into Grit RIFF Format. This will compile your paletted textures into **.grf** format in the *grf* folder.

Be aware the paletted textures come with more restrictions than BMP textures, the primary being an absolute maximum of 16 colors per texture. However, some textures may have even tighter default palette restrictions, which can be modified at the risk of running out of palette memory (see below).

#### Advanced Theming

Occasionally, you may require more than the default number of colors for some paletted textures. In such cases, you may modify the `.grit` compilation file for the texture to increase the size of the palette.

For example, in `scroll_window.grit`, you may edit `-pn7` and change `7` to `16` for 16 colors. Be aware that if you remove the entire `-pn` line, you may encounter unexpected results.

Also note that the absolute maximum of 16 colors per texture is enforced in code and can not be modified. Even if you increase the number of palettes to above 16, no more than 16 colors worth of palette data will be loaded. With the amount of textures loaded in, there may not be enough palette memory to hold 16 colors worth of palettes for every texture. Keep this in mind when adjusting palette sizes.

Additionally, paletted textures must have dimensions that are a multiple of 2. Paletted textures sizes can not be changed except for `bubble` and `start_border`, which can have configurable sprite dimensions in `theme.ini`. However, note that doing so may have unexpected consequences.

Paletted textures are not checked for validity. An invalid texture should be rare if created with the provided makefile, but in certain cases a corrupted texture will cause the menu to not load at all.

The 3DS theme loads its rotating cubes animation from the file located at `/video/3dsRotatingCubes.rvid` in RocketVideo format. If you wish for this not to draw for theme purposes, the file can simply be deleted.

The easiest way of customizing a theme is by editing the BMP textures in a theme's *ui*, *battery*, or *volume* folder. These BMP textures must be in RGB565 format, and use `#FF00FF` as a transparent key color. BMP textures are allowed to vary in size, but may require tweaking of the theme configuration to render correctly (see below).

Changes to paletted textures, or backgrounds are more involved. Within the *grit* or *background_grit* folder of a theme, the various image files may be edited. You will also require [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) with GRIT installed. Once you have finished editing your files, you must run

```bash
$ make
```

Do not make any changes to the *.grit* file until you have read the section below on advanced theming.

In order to compile your themes into Grit RIFF Format. This will compile your paletted textures into **.grf** format in the *grf* folder.

Be aware the paletted textures come with more restrictions than BMP textures, the primary being an absolute maximum of 16 colors per texture. However, some textures may have even tighter default palette restrictions, which can be modified at the risk of running out of palette memory (see below).

#### Advanced Theming

Occasionally, you may require more than the default number of colors for some paletted textures. In such cases, you may modify the `.grit` compilation file for the texture to increase the size of the palette. Note that the `.grit` files for backgrounds **should not** be changed. The background files are not paletted, but losslessly compressed, and you are allowed full 16-bit full color in backgrounds.

For example, in `scroll_window.grit`, you may edit `-pn7` and change `7` to `16` for 16 colors. Be aware that if you remove the entire `-pn` line, you may encounter unexpected results.

Also note that the absolute maximum of 16 colors per texture is enforced in code and can not be modified. Even if you increase the number of palettes to above 16, no more than 16 colors worth of palette data will be loaded. With the amount of textures loaded in, there may not be enough palette memory to hold 16 colors worth of palettes for every texture. Keep this in mind when adjusting palette sizes.

Additionally, paletted textures must have dimensions that are a multiple of 2. Paletted textures sizes can not be changed except for `bubble` and `start_border`, which can have configurable sprite dimensions in `theme.ini`. However, note that doing so may have unexpected consequences.

Paletted textures are not checked for validity. An invalid texture should be rare if created with the provided makefile, but in certain cases a corrupted texture will cause the menu to not load at all.

The 3DS theme loads its rotating cubes animation from the file located at `/video/3dsRotatingCubes.rvid` in RocketVideo format. If you wish for this not to draw for theme purposes, the file can simply be deleted.)

#### Custom Background Music and Sound fonts.

The DSi Menu and 3DS themes also support custom music. See [sound.md](https://github.com/RocketRobz/TWiLightMenu/tree/master/romsel_dsimenutheme/resources/sound/sound.md) for more details.
