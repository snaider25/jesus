Q: Why isn't touch input working when I use the `Quick-start ROM` option?    
A: You're either using an outdated version of nds-bootstrap, or you tried to launch a game in DSiMenu++, after using the "Start last-ran ROM" option on 3DS.    
Go into settings, then exit settings by pressing B. This issue will be fixed in the next DSiMenu++ version.    
If touch is still broken, delete `nds-bootstrap.ini` and uninstall TWLoader.    
After deleting the .ini file, go into DSiMenu++ settings, then exit settings by pressing B.
