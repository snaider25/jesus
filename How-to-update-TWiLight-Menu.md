NOTE: Starting with v6.8.3, DS game saves will have to be moved to a folder called `saves`. The folder should be made in the same folder as the DS ROMs.

**Update instructions**
1. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/RocketRobz/TWiLightMenu/releases).
2. Overwrite the `_nds` folder and `boot.nds` file on the SD root, with the new ones from the .7z file.
3. For DSi CFW users, put `title` folder from `CFW - SDNAND root` folder, onto the SD card root.
If you're asked to merge, click `Yes`. Be careful if you're on Mac OS, as it'll overwrite it, instead of merging.
4. On 3DS, delete TWiLight Menu++ from DSiWare Data Management in System Settings.
5. Install the two CIAs in the `cia` folder.
