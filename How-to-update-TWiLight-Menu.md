## DSi CFW Update instructions
1. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/RocketRobz/TWiLightMenu/releases).
2. Copy `_nds/`, the folders in `DSi - CFW users/SDNAND root/`, and `DSi&3DS - SD card users/_nds/` to the root of your SD.
   - When copying from `DSi - CFW users/SDNAND root/` if you're asked to merge, click `Yes`. Be careful if you're on macOS, as it'll overwrite it, instead of merging.
